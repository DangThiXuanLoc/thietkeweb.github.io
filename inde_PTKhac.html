    <h2>Low and Slow</h2>
    <p>This week I am extremely excited about a new cooking technique called sous vide.
        In sous vide cooking, you submerge the food (usually vacuum-sealed in plastic)
        into a water bath that is precisely set to the target temperature you want the
        food to be cooked to. In his book, Cooking for Geeks, Jeff Potter describes it
        as ultra-low-temperature poaching.</p>
    <p>Next month, we will be serving Sous Vide Salmon with Dill Hollandaise. To reserve a seat at the chef table, contact
        us before November 30.</p>

    <p>Warning: Sous vide cooked salmon is not pasteurized. Avoid it if you are pregnant or have
    immunity issues.</p>
